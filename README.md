# project_x
It's a program for solving a system of linear equations applying genetic algroithms. It can solve systems like Ax=b, where A - is a square matrix with dimension <= 100.

## Structure
* In main.cpp there is all code. (I know it's not so good to keep pretty big projects in one file, but I wasn't experienced enough when I was writing this program).
* In directory [input_examples] you can find examples of matrices to input in the program.
* In directory [screenshots] there are images of obtained results in the process of developing.
* Rest files are about the purpose and result and written on Russian.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository and move to it locally
2. Input command in the console: `g++ main.cpp` and follow instructions
3. You can use matrices for input which are located in [input_examples]
